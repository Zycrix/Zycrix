# Hi there!

My name is Kristoffer Mikkelsen. I'm a recent graduate of Noroff school of technology and digital media with a higher professional degree in front-end development from Stavanger, Norway. I am currently looking for a job as a front-end developer!

## Experience

From my studies i've learnt html, css, javascript, React and SCSS, and more. For a complete list of all the technologies i've worked with please visit my portfolio page! Unrelated to my studies i've got some experience with C++ and a robot programming language from my previous job called Yaskawa inform, which is a proprietary programming language somewhat similar to C++. Working with these robots is what really got me into programming, and opened my eyes to the wonderful world of coding.
