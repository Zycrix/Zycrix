# Hi there!

My name is Kristoffer Mikkelsen. I'm a front-end student at Noroff school of technology and digital media from Stavanger, Norway. For now i'm mainly focused on the front-end technologies but my end goal is to go fullstack.

## Experience

From my studies so far i've learnt html, css and javascript, we've also worked a bit with wordpress, bot as a headless cms and a regular cms. Unrelated to my studies i've got some experience with C++ and a robot programming language from my previous job called Yaskawa inform, which is a proprietary programming language based heavily on C. Working with these robots is what really got me into programming, and opened my eyes to the wonderful world of coding.
